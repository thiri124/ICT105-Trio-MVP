## Idea 

### Problem Area
University students frequently need short-term access to specialized tools (like DSLR cameras, Arduino kits, graphing calculators, or textbook editions) or quick help (like video editing or lab setup assistance), but buying them new is expensive and finding someone to help is chaotic.

### Target Users
University students and campus club members.

### Current Alternative
Messy, unstructured posts on informal channels like Reddit, Discord servers, or Facebook groups where posts quickly get buried.

### Proposed IT Solution
An internal campus network web application requiring a student email login where students can list items they are willing to lend out (or skills they can offer) and request things they need, backed by a simple request/approval workflow.

### Possible Technology
Tailwind CSS with React for the frontend, and Supabase or Firebase to handle user authentication (with email verification) and a PostgreSQL database to manage users, listings, and rental transactions.

### Why This Is Suitable
It solves a specific, relatable community problem. The prototype focuses heavily on database relationships (linking users to items and managing transaction states), which perfectly aligns with standard IT web-development curriculum goals.
